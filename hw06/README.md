### Reporting the process
- The exercises in R for Data Science: Strings were very useful, I hope to go back in my freetime and do more exercises from other chapters

- Using map functions are really helpful to simplfy code, I used both map and an lapply function to find the geocodes of artists and map was a lot easier to read and compute and made a much easier to use dataframe of nested lists.  Map also let me decided what the output would be formatted as

- Messy data is a headache.  I tried to clean up the `city` variable in singer_locations the best I could but it was simply too messy and inconsistent in how data was entered.  Using str_subset was good to find some nested data

- Leaflet is great!
